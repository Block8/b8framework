b8 Framework
============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Block8/b8framework.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Block8/b8framework)


*b8 framework* is a lightweight, simple framework for high-throughput PHP applications. It does not enforce a specific type of application, nor particularly an application structure, it simply helps you to build things. 

We've used the framework to build web sites, APIs, and web applications, each handling tens of millions of requests a month.


*b8 framework repository is _not quite_ ready for general consumption yet. We have a tool to help you generate all of your project CRUD for you, which still needs to be included. This will be done over the next few days.*
