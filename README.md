============
[![Build Status](http://phpci.block8.net/build-status/image/1)](http://phpci.block8.net/project/view/1)


*b8 framework* is a lightweight, simple framework for high-throughput PHP applications. It does not enforce a specific type of application, nor particularly an application structure, it simply helps you to build things. 

We've used the framework to build web sites, APIs, and web applications, each handling tens of millions of requests a month.
